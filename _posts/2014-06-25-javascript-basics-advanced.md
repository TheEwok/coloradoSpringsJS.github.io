Mike Lockett leads a discussion on general JavaScript, from basics to advanced.

Hello JavaScript, Syntax, Types and type conversions, Scope and contexts, closures, strict mode, counter-intuitive behavior. I'll be focusing on the core language and not the environments (e.g. browsers, NodeJS etc), starting with very basic stuff, then gradually moving to advanced stuff, especially highlighting things where JavaScript's behavior is different from other languages.
